# Library PC Management

This system was designed to manage and monitor PC usage in a library. It tracks the check-in and check-out times of students using the PCs, displays real-time PC availability, and maintains a list of banned students who are restricted from requesting PC access. Banned students can only be unbanned with administrator approval.
