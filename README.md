# Library PC Management

This system is designed to manage and monitor PC usage in a library. It tracks the check-in and check-out times of students using the PCs, displays real-time PC availability, and maintains a list of banned students who are restricted from requesting PC access. Banned students can only be unbanned with approval from the librarian or administrator. The system features separate interfaces for students and librarians/administrators.
